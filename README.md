# Real-Time-Edge-Detection 

Real-Time Edge Detection using OpenCV in Python

Canny Edge Detection Method

The objective of the program given is to perform edge detection of images in real-time. The popular canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect a wide range of edges in images. OpenCV has in-built function cv2.Canny() which takes our input image as first argument and its aperture size(min value and max value) as last two arguments.
